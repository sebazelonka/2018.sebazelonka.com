This is a first step into a new journey I'm starting.

One of my goals this year, is to start to share what I learn while I'm working developing components libraries. At least as a reminder for myself.

There are a lot of articles saying that is good to write what you learn, but [this (old)one](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/03/publish-what-you-learn/) from Smashing Magazine is a good starting point.

Next week I'll attend a Brad Frost workshop [**Creating and Maintaining Successful Design Systems**](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/design-systems-brad-frost/) and appart from that, I'm gaining a lot of experience working on a project to implement a comoponents package to be used across the company.

This is it. A short and simple post. A commitment with myself. Let's see what happens :)
