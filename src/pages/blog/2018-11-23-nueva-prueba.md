  Unlike file collections, folder collections have the option to allow editors
  to create new items in the collection. This is set by the boolean create
  field.

Note: Folder collections must have at least one field with the name title for creating new entry slugs. That field should use the default string widget. The label for the field can be any string value. If you wish to use a different field as your identifier, set identifier_field to the field name. See the Collections reference doc for details on how collections and fields are configured. If you forget to add this field, you will get an error that your collection "must have a field that is a valid entry identifier".
